# Lottery honesty

## What is it?

This is a statistics study about lottery honesty using a test for association (independence).
It does NOT prove that a lottery system is not biased, but it points against or in his favor.

## Motivation

Sometimes I heard people say that lottery is not fair, things like: they pick the winners, the result is biased some way, etc. 
But non of those argued pointing to a scientific study, and as I couldn't find one, I'm doing this by my own.

## How does a test for association works?

We establish two hypothesis, one that tells the system is not biased, the other tells the opposite (biased system).
We compare the expected values to be seen and the actual seen values using the chi-square statistic, finally this is going to give a probability for our conclusion between the two hypothesis.

## The chosen system

It was chosen the *Lotof√°cil* system which is brazilian lottery system consisting of 25 numbers, ordered from 1 to 25, 
where 15 numbers are randomly riffled, the maximum prize is achieved by guessing all the 15 numbers correctly.
This was the chosen system just because it belongs to the government, this means all data used in this study is opensource.
